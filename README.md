Dive into Stalligence on our GitHub Repository and see how we make e-commerce data work for you! 

Stalligence is a cross-platform e-commerce intelligence system that transforms scattered marketplace data into actionable insights: helping brands understand why performance changes and act ahead of the market.

Stalligence aggregates data across digital shelves and converts it into real-time intelligence—all in one intuitive dashboard.
